## Project 4: CS 7650 Natural Language Processing <br> Sentiment Analysis for Earning Transcripts (Financial Data)

Note this project required a report which required answering a number of questions about the project's methodology. We've added the questions as well as corresponding answers to serve as the project description (so the GitHub page is instead a PDF for this project).
